Pymaceuticals, Inc has been screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 
Squamous cell carcinoma, according to Jones(2024, July 27), is a common type of skin cancer that affects millions of people worldwide. This form of cancer develops in the squamous cells, which are found in the outer layer of the skin and in the lining of certain organs. As the second most prevalent form of skin cancer, it poses a significant health concern and has the potential to spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.

I have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.


The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.


The executive team has directed me to create all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. In addition, provide a top-level summary of the study results.


The resulting charts and plot were created using matplotlib, pyplot, pandas, numpy and scipy.stats.  
Bar Charts and Pie Charts were created using using Pandas DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot methods. 
And scipy.stats to create the Box Plot, Line and Scatter Plots, and Linear Regression Model.

Top Level Summary (Results): Capomulin and Ramicine were effective in treating and rdcuing the size of the tumors in the respective mice. In addition, the two drugs shown an increase in metastatic sites.
in addition, the average tumor size increased proportionally to mouse weight when treated with Capomulin
